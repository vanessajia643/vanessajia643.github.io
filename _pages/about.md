Hi there! :wave: My name is Luyuan Jia (I go by Vanessa), and I’m a research fellow working with Professor [Marcella Alsan](https://scholar.harvard.edu/alsan/home) at the [Health Inequality Lab](https://www.healthinequalitylab.org/) in Harvard Kennedy School. My current research interests are industrial organization, health, and public economics. Specifically, I'm passionate about exploring how diverse health policies and public sector dynamics impact people’s well-being across different health markets.

Prior to this position, I obtained my bachelor's degree in economics in 2023 at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). In Spring 2022, I was also an exchange student at UC Berkeley, where I worked with Professor [Nick Tsivanidis](https://www.nicktsivanidis.com/) on implementing machine learning tools in development economics research.


**Research Interest** : Industrial Organization, Health Economics, and Public Economics
